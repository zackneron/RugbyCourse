### Run project

Use ** gulp sync ** to load the page/project

### Duration of the assessment

The assessment took me 3 days to complete. I started with the mobile first approach which took most of my time in general. 

### Bugs

I struggled with the **HK Grotesk-Bold Legacy** font which I could not get. I have noticed the free one I used is not giving me the result that I wanted as per the day.

At the ** Ready to go** section the background image asset is empty and could not be downloaded. I have used the Desktop background image for the mobile devices as well.

I have also noticed the primary button background gradient were not the same across some buttons. I was wondering if there was a reason for that or it was a designer's mistake. I have decided to keep them the same across all buttons for consistancy. 

## Chalenging section

The most challenging part of the assessment was to customize the video with JavaScript which took me some time to get some functionality to work.
